# Incident Response Tool

The goal is to understand the client server model from the perspective of python.  

For this scenario you will be creating a tool to assist with monitoring and incident response across a network. 

Some very basic inital client / server code has been provided and both of these can be run on your local kali vm. The easiest way is to run two terminals, start the server in one:

python3 server.py -a "127.0.0.1" -p 5000  

And the client in the other:

python3 client.py
