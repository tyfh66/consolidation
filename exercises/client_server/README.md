# Incident Response Tool

The goal is to understand the client server model from the perspective of python.  

For this scenario you will be creating a tool to assist with incident response across a network. Imagine a host / hosts have been compromised on your network and the types of information you would need to pull back from them. 

Some very basic inital client / server code has been provided and both of these can be run on your local box. The easiest way is to run two terminals, start the server in one:

python3 server.py -a "127.0.0.1" -p 5000  

And the client in the other:

python3 client.py
